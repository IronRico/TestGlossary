obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis. 
Raw data has not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or 
technician. [Wikipedia] See also: [Processed Data](https://ironrico.github.io/TestGlossary/P).

### **Reproducible:**
(Analyses, workflow, or research): structuring activities so that a product (e.g., a data set, analysis result,

role in reproducibility.
